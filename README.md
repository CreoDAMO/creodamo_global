Here are some key points about the structure:

- The `creodamo/` folder is the main Django project folder.
- Inside the `creodamo/` folder, you will find the Django project files such as `settings.py`, `urls.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, and others.
- The `apps/` folder contains the Django apps for each component or functionality. Each app has its own set of files, including `models.py`, `views.py`, and other files specific to that app.
- The `frontend/` folder is where you can find the frontend code, which could be built using React or Vue.js, for example. It can have subfolders such as `build/`, `public/`, `src/`, and others, depending on the frontend framework or build system used.
- The `docs/` folder is for documentation related to the project.
- The `tests/` folder is where you can place your test scripts.
- The `tools/` folder can contain any helper scripts or tools used in the project.
- The `scripts/` folder is for any additional scripts needed for the project.
- The `config/` folder can hold configuration files for the project.
- The `pyproject.toml` file specifies the project dependencies using the Poetry package manager.
- The `README.md` file provides instructions or information about the project.
- Other files and folders not specified explicitly are left open for the specific needs and requirements of the project.
